# Menstruation Cycle Information for Treniren App

## Overview
This file contains the basic information needed to implement menstruation cycle tracking and reminders in the Treniren training diary app.

Sure, here is the content from the graphics, transcribed and translated into English.

### Menstruation Phase
* **Cycle days**: approx. 1-7
* **Physiology**: Low estrogen and progesterone levels.
* **Impact on climbing**: Drop in energy, increased fatigue, worse concentration. Moderate training often alleviates symptoms. Good strength results are possible.
* **Goal**: Maintain activity while reducing intensity. Work on technique and mobility.
* **Trainer's tips**:
    * Low energy levels or cramps don't necessarily mean you have to skip training, but rest is fully justified.
    * Adjust intensity and training load, shorten session length to avoid excessive fatigue.
    * Reduce volume (fewer attempts or reps) and increase rest between tries.
    * Focus on technique and mobility; if you feel good, sub-maximal strength training (70-90% of max strength) is possible.
    * Approach training with flexibility – your body may react differently than usual during this time.
    * Planning a recovery week during your period can optimize your training experience.
    * Even light training will make it easier to get back to full load in the following cycle phases.

### Follicular Phase
* **Cycle days**: approx. 8-12
* **Physiology**: Rising estrogen, low progesterone. The length of this phase varies and can be delayed due to stress, illness, or energy availability.
* **Impact on climbing**: High energy, better recovery, greater tolerance for pain and load. Faster learning of movements. Many people feel stronger and have more energy during this phase.
* **Goal**: Optimal time for intense training.
* **Trainer's tips**:
    * Your climbing goals and abilities – not your cycle – should dictate your training plan.
    * Within these guidelines, you can maintain flexibility, e.g., by choosing to increase training intensity and/or volume.
    * This is a good time to work on difficult projects and test your limits.
    * Focus on maximum strength sessions, hard bouldering, attempts on tough routes, and power training.
    * Monitor your well-being: rising estrogen levels are usually associated with more energy and motivation. If you don't feel this way, it might be caused by stress, too little food, or insufficient recovery.

### Ovulation
* **Cycle days**: approx. 13-16
* **Physiology**: Peak estrogen, possible short-term increase in testosterone.
* **Impact on climbing**: Some people feel at their peak of form and motivation, while others experience discomfort. You may feel better dynamics and coordination, but at the same time, ligament susceptibility to overload increases.
* **Goal**: Maximize power while taking care of your joints and ligaments.
* **Trainer's tips**:
    * If you feel strong, you can reach a peak level of intensity.
    * If not, choose higher volume with a lower risk of overload.
    * The risk of injury may be higher, but studies are not conclusive – focus on training load and recovery.
    * Tackle difficult projects and dynamic moves, but with a long warm-up and caution, without forcing your joints.

### Early Luteal Phase
* **Cycle days**: approx. 17-20
* **Physiology**: High progesterone, moderate estrogen. Body temperature may be slightly higher, and perception of effort can change. There are large individual differences in feelings and hormone levels during this phase.
* **Impact on climbing**: Possible slight drop in power and recovery rate.
* **Goal**: Continue your training plan by adjusting intensity to how you feel. A good time to work on technique, strength endurance, and movement control.
* **Trainer's tips**:
    * **Days 17-20**: High intensity, low volume. Train intensely and perform fewer repetitions, with more strength exercises. Go for dynamic movements.
    * **Days 21-24**: Low intensity, high volume.
    * If a workout feels harder, don't just look at the number of moves or the grade; listen to your body and adjust the pace according to how you feel.
    * Focus on strength endurance training, longer routes, technique, and calm, high-volume sessions.
    * Physical exercises are just as important as rest during this phase. Regular exercise reduces the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).

### Late Luteal Phase (PMS)
* **Cycle days**: approx. 21-28
* **Physiology**: High progesterone, dropping estrogen.
* **Impact on climbing**: Mood swings, water retention, worse coordination, and concentration.
* **Goal**: Maintain training consistency without pressure to perform. A good time for a deload, calmer climbing, repeats, and refining details.
* **Trainer's tips**:
    * Stick to simple, technical movements without unnecessary tension.
    * Reduce the strength load.
    * Use this phase to maintain consistency – an effective workout doesn't always require maximum effort.
    * You can focus on different training goals, like technique, execution, or tactics.
    * In this phase, deep thoughts come to you more naturally. Take some time to get to know the route, watch someone else's beta, and remember you can always return to the problem during the follicular phase.
